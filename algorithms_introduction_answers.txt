2. Tesla has a really efficient self-driving algorithm that has made them
extremely successful and at the cutting-edge of technology. Their algorithm
is impressive because it makes an enormous amount of calculations every second
to not only keep a driver safe, but also to get them from point A to point B
without any input from the driver.

YouTube also has a very successful algorithm that they use for generating the
content that every user sees when he or she logs in to their YouTube account.
The algorithm is intelligent enough that it knows what types of videos you are
watching and recommends similar content from other creators.

The way that in-n-out makes their burgers is an efficient algorithm as well
because they are able to replicate the same experience and same taste from their
burgers no matter what restaurant you visit. The success of their "algorithm"
makes it so that their burgers are always consistent.

3. I believe that an efficient algorithm needs to be consistent and accurate
in the shortest amount possible. There needs to be a perfect balance of results
and time so that you can maximize the efficiency of an algorithm.
